    <h1>Welcome.</h1>
      <p>It seems easy enough to learn HTML and CSS in order to get yourself a good static webpage up; but there are so many HTML/CSS tricks now with the newest implementations, that it is easy to skip learning some of the lesser-known bits.  That is, in my opinion, not the way to go about coding. It is sad to miss out on things that can be useful, especially for something like HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>So I have put together this page in order to show, not just a list of tags, but examples of how they work. I hope that you find it useful, and I encourage you to pull this off of GitHub and contribute to it's build. This is not a repo to make me famous, but just a little tool that can hopefully do a lot of people a lot of good.</p>
